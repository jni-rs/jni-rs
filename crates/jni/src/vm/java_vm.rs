///
/// We also guarantee that if you currently have an [`AttachGuard`] thread attachment (or a `Env`
/// reference), that implies that [`JavaVM::singleton()`] has been initialized and will return a
/// valid [`JavaVM`].

/// An existing JavaVM can be obtained either via [`JavaVM::singleton`], or [`Env::get_java_vm`]
/// in an already attached thread, or a new VM can be [launched](#launching-jvm-from-rust) via
/// [`JavaVM::new`].
///
/// ## Minimum supported JNI version is 1.4
///
/// The implementation of this crate assumes your Java VM supports at least JNI >= 1.4
///
/// The implementation wouldn't be able to call `ExceptionCheck` without JNI 1.2 and requiring >=
/// 1.4 means we don't need any runtime version checks for the direct byte buffer APIs.
///
/// Since `GetVersion` requires a [`Env`] and is not one of the JNI APIs that is safe to use with
/// pending exceptions then the implementation is not always able to explicitly assert the supported
/// version.
///
/// ## Attaching Native Threads
///
/// Your application always needs to explicitly attach `jni-rs` to the current thread before it can
/// access the [`Env`] API (most of the interesting APIs are under [`Env`]).
///
/// If you're implementing a native/foreign method then JNI will pass a thread attachment (in the
/// form of a raw [`sys::JNIEnv`] pointer that should be captured using the
/// [`env::EnvUnowned`] type) and converted into a [`Env`] reference via
/// [`env::EnvUnowned::with_env`])
///
/// Note: [`Env`] is not a `#[transparent]` wrapper over a [`sys::JNIEnv`] pointer.
///
/// The attachment of the current thread is always represented via an [`AttachGuard`] which blocks
/// the thread from being detached and acts as a marker for a JNI stack frame.
///
/// [`Env`] is only ever exposed in the public API by-reference, and will always borrow from an
/// [`AttachGuard`] such that it's lifetime is tied to a fixed JNI stack frame.
///
/// Unless you are using `unsafe` APIs though, the [`AttachGuard`] itself will usually be hidden,
/// and you will get a [`Env`] reference (that borrows from a hidden [`AttachGuard`]).
///
/// This library supports these modes of attachment:
/// * A permanent attachment with [`JavaVM::attach_current_thread`]. The thread will automatically
///   detach itself before it terminates (recommended for attaching in native threads).
/// * A scoped attachment with [`JavaVM::attach_current_thread_for_scope`]. The thread will
///   automatically detach itself once your given closure returns (and the hidden [`AttachGuard`]
///   is dropped).
/// * Implicit ("unowned") attachments, for use in native methods. The thread will never get
///   explicitly detached by `jni-rs` if we have implicit attachment.
///
/// ### Local Reference Management
///
/// Remember that the native thread attached to the VM must manage local references
/// carefully, i.e., do not allocate an excessive number of references and release them promptly when
/// they are no longer needed to enable the GC to collect them.
///
/// A common approach is to push appropriately-sized local frames for larger
/// code fragments (see [`Env::with_local_frame`] or [`JavaVM::with_local_frame`])
/// and [`objects::Auto`] for temporary references in loops.
///
/// See also the [JNI specification][spec-references] for details on referencing Java objects.
///
/// ## Launching JVM from Rust
///
/// To [launch][launch-vm] a JVM from a native process, enable the `invocation` feature in the
/// Cargo.toml:
///
/// ```toml
/// jni = { version = "0.22.1", features = ["invocation"] }
/// ```
///
/// The application will be able to use [`JavaVM::new`] which will dynamically load a `jvm` library
/// (which is distributed with the JVM) at runtime:
///
/// ```rust,ignore-aarch64-linux-android
/// # use jni::errors;
/// # //
/// # // Ignore this test without invocation feature, so that simple `cargo test` works
/// # #[cfg(feature = "invocation")]
/// # fn main() -> errors::StartJvmResult<()> {
/// # use jni::{jni_sig, jni_str, AttachGuard, objects::JValue, InitArgsBuilder, Env, JNIVersion, JavaVM, sys::jint};
/// # //
/// // Build the VM properties
/// let jvm_args = InitArgsBuilder::new()
///           // Pass the JNI API version (default is 8)
///           .version(JNIVersion::V1_8)
///           // You can additionally pass any JVM options (standard, like a system property,
///           // or VM-specific).
///           // Here we enable some extra JNI checks useful during development
///           .option("-Xcheck:jni")
///           .build()
///           .unwrap();
///
/// // Create a new VM
/// let jvm = JavaVM::new(jvm_args)?;
///
/// // Attach the current thread to call to the JavaVM
/// jvm.attach_current_thread(|env| -> errors::Result<()> {
///     // Call Java Math#abs(-10)
///     let x = JValue::from(-10);

///         .i()?;
///
///     assert_eq!(val, 10);
///     Ok(())
/// });
///
/// # Ok(()) }
/// #
/// # // This is a stub that gets run instead if the invocation feature is not built
/// # #[cfg(not(feature = "invocation"))]
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// At runtime, the JVM installation path is determined via the [java-locator] crate:
/// 1. By the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, if it is set.
/// 2. Otherwise — from `java` output.
///
/// It is recommended to set `JAVA_HOME`
///
/// For the operating system to correctly load the `jvm` library it may also be necessary to update
/// the path that the OS uses to find dependencies of the `jvm` library.
/// * On **Windows**, append the path to `$JAVA_HOME/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.
/// * On **MacOS**, append the path to `libjvm.dylib` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.
/// * On **Linux**, append the path to `libjvm.so` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.

/// Represents a JNI attachment of the current thread to a Java VM, which is
/// required before you can access the [`Env`] API.
///
/// [`AttachGuard`] is an `unsafe`, low-level building block for the safe thread
/// attachment APIs provided by [`JavaVM`]. Before considering this API you
/// should look at:
///
///   - [`JavaVM::attach_current_thread()`]
///   - [`JavaVM::attach_current_thread_for_scope()`]
///   - [`JavaVM::attach_current_thread_with_config()`]
///   - [`JavaVM::with_local_frame()`]
///   - [`JavaVM::with_top_local_frame()`]
///
/// More-specifically, an [`AttachGuard`] only represents an attachment for a
/// single JNI stack frame or local reference frame.
///
/// The lifetime for an [`AttachGuard`] effectively names the scope of a single
/// JNI stack frame. The lifetime of the guard is used to ensure that any local
/// references created via the [`Env`] API are only accessible within the
/// lifetime of the guard, which ensures that local references can't be used
/// outside of the JNI stack frame that owns them.
///
/// If the [`AttachGuard`] "owns" the underlying JNI thread attachment, that
/// means the guard will automatically detach the current thread from the Java
/// VM when the guard is dropped.
///
/// If you're implementing a JNI native method which is passed a raw
/// [`crate::sys::JNIEnv`] pointer, then you can get a corresponding guard via
/// [`AttachGuard::from_unowned`].
///
/// If you're implementing some JNI utility code that doesn't already have a raw
/// [`crate::sys::JNIEnv`] pointer you could use
/// [`JavaVM::attach_current_thread_guard`] to get an attachment guard.
///
/// # JavaVM::singleton() guarantee
///
/// If you know that at least one [`AttachGuard`] has ever existed (which is
/// implied if you have a [`Env`] reference) you can assume that
/// [`JavaVM::singleton()`] will return `Some(JavaVM)`.
///
/// This can be useful if you need to access JNI from something like a Drop
/// implementation, without needing to explicitly copy `JavaVM` pointers. In
/// these cases you can often prove that at least one `AttachGuard` must have
/// existed in order to construct the object that will later be dropped.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// [`AttachGuard`] management is considered `unsafe` because there are some
/// safety rules that can't be automatically guaranteed through the Rust type
/// system alone...
///
/// 1. You must treat a guard as an immovable type that needs to live on the
///    stack and can't be re-ordered relative to other guards on the stack.
///
/// 2. Following from (1), an [`AttachGuard`] _MUST NOT_ be given a `'static`
///    lifetime (e.g. by boxing or moving into a `static` variable).
///
/// 3. Any low-level JNI code that creates new local references must
///    runtime-assert that it has exclusive access to the top-most
///    [`AttachGuard`] on the stack.
///
///    If you're only using the safe [`Env`] API then this is handled for you,
///    but if you're implementing low-level JNI code that somehow creates local
///    references without involving a checked `Env` API you must add fail-safe
///    runtime assertions. (See [`Env::assert_top`])
///
/// # Safety Guidance
///
/// If you do need to use an [`AttachGuard`] directly, then it's recommended
/// that the guard should be kept private to a function that uses so it isn't
/// ever exposed to safe code.
///
/// It's very important that [`AttachGuard`]s are never given a `'static`
/// lifetime or re-ordered relative to other guards on the stack and keeping the
/// guard private to a function is a good way to ensure that it remains fixed on
/// the stack.
///
/// Beware of making it too easy to repeatedly materialize access to a mutable
/// [`Env`] and increasing the risk that safe code could attempt to create new
/// local references with an [`Env`] reference that is not at the top of the
/// stack. If this happens the API will panic at runtime to avoid undefined
/// behavior.

///    same order that it was created, relative to other guards (LIFO order).
