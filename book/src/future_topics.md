# Future Topics

The Counter exercise needs a solution, which discusses in more detail how to
eliminate data races, use-after-free, double-frees, and guarantee that native
resources are eventually freed.

jni-rs has additional abstractions that haven't been discussed, like executors.
JNI also has a few features that need their own sections (critical APIs, and
local and global references).

There are also performance optimizations that haven't been covered. For example,
it is more efficient to issue calls from Java to native code than from native
code to Java, and [caching class/methodIds/fieldIds can reduce the number of
upcalls that are
necessary.](https://docs.rs/jni/0.19.0/jni/struct.JNIEnv.html#checked-and-unchecked-methods)

There is open work that could simplify portions of the book. For example, [a
native peer registry](https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs/issues/84) can help
guarantee that raw pointers passed in the [counter
exercise](./counter_exercise.md) are valid and of the correct type, and
["auto-generate native Java-interfacing
files"](https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs/issues/81) could simplify the current
steps for creating JNI functions, which involves translating C header files into
Rust code.

There are also opportunities to talk about handling shared resources between
native resources and Java proxies.
