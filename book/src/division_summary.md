# Division Exercise Summary

To recap, in the division exercise, you:

1. Wrote JNI code for Rust to perform division.
2. May have tested panics across the JNI boundary, and seen a crash (undefined
   behavior).

In the next chapter, we'll explore a few error handling patterns so that we are
less likely to observe jvm crashes.
