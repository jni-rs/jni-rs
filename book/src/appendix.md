The appendix currently contains troubleshooting and setup information. In the

## java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError
```
java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: no jnibookrs in java.library.path: [/usr/java/packages/lib, /usr/lib64, /lib64, /lib, /usr/lib]

    at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadLibrary(ClassLoader.java:2660)
    at java.base/java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary0(Runtime.java:829)

```

Read the directories listed in the Exception message. It tells you where
Java looked for the shared library. If you donâ€™t see your path listed, then you
need to try a different variable. Otherwise, you must ensure it contains the
shared library.

If you're using OS X, check whether you're using a recent version. Since El
Capitan, SIP prevents setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. If you aren't sure which
version you're using, you can click the Apple icon and "About this Mac" to find
out. Refer to [MacOS version
history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_version_history) to tell whether
yours is newer than El Capitan.

Your Mac most likely doesn't allow you to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` if you bought it
new after 2014. If you're on OSX El Capitan or newer (and have SIP enabled),
ensure you're using `java.library.path` and are setting it as a Java property.
If you're on older versions of OSX, ensure you're using `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` and
not `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

## Setting Java Properties

This section provides further details on how to set Java properties for various
Java build systems.

### Gradle
Java properties can be set for tests, like so:

```
test {
    // Only bother with this if you're on Yosemite or newer.
    systemProperty "java.library.path", "/path/to/jnibookrs/target/debug"
}
```

## IntelliJ Guided Setup

This section covers setting environment variables for IntelliJ. Setup your run
configuration to use the same variables and values as the CLI. Then, run a unit
test to verify that everything works as expected.

```bash
# For Linux/Windows:
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/jnibookrs/target/debug;RUST_BACKTRACE=1
# For OSX:
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/jnibookrs/target/debug;RUST_BACKTRACE=1
```

If you need to set `java.library.path` instead, then set it as a Java property
instead of as an environment variable.

## Debugging
### CLion Instructions
If you're using CLion, follow ["Attaching to a Local
   Process"](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/attaching-to-local-process.html)
