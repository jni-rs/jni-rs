/// The Java VM, providing [Invocation API][invocation-api] support.
///
/// The JavaVM can be obtained either via [`JNIEnv#get_java_vm`][get-vm] in an already attached
/// thread, or it can be [launched](#launching-jvm-from-rust) from Rust via `JavaVM#new`.
///
/// ## Attaching Native Threads
///
/// A native thread must «attach» itself to be able to call Java methods outside of a native Java
/// method. This library provides two modes of attachment, each ensuring the thread is promptly
/// detached:
/// * A scoped attachment with [`attach_current_thread`][act].
///   The thread will automatically detach itself once the returned guard is dropped.
/// * A permanent attachment with [`attach_current_thread_permanently`][actp]
///   or [`attach_current_thread_as_daemon`][actd].
///   The thread will automatically detach itself before it terminates.
///
/// As attachment and detachment of a thread is an expensive operation, the scoped attachment
/// shall be used if happens infrequently. If you have an undefined scope where you need
/// to use `JNIEnv` and cannot keep the `AttachGuard`, consider attaching the thread
/// permanently.
///
/// ### Local Reference Management
///
/// Remember that the native thread attached to the VM **must** manage the local references
/// properly, i.e., do not allocate an excessive number of references and release them promptly
/// when they are no longer needed to enable the GC to collect them. A common approach is to use
/// an appropriately-sized local frame for larger code fragments
/// (see [`with_local_frame`](struct.JNIEnv.html#method.with_local_frame) and [Executor](#executor))
/// and [auto locals](struct.JNIEnv.html#method.auto_local) in loops.
///
/// See also the [JNI specification][spec-references] for details on referencing Java objects.
///
/// ### Executor
///
/// Jni-rs provides an [`Executor`](struct.Executor.html) — a helper struct that allows to
/// execute a closure with `JNIEnv`. It combines the performance benefits of permanent attaches
/// *and* automatic local reference management. Prefer it to manual permanent attaches if
/// they happen in various parts of the code to reduce the burden of local reference management.
///
/// ## Launching JVM from Rust
///
/// To [launch][launch-vm] a JVM from a native process, enable the `invocation`
/// feature in the Cargo.toml:
///
/// ```toml
/// jni = { version = "0.21.1", features = ["invocation"] }
/// ```
///
/// The application will be able to use [`JavaVM::new`] which will dynamically
/// load a `jvm` library (which is distributed with the JVM) at runtime:
///
/// ```rust
/// # use jni::errors;
/// # //
/// # // Ignore this test without invocation feature, so that simple `cargo test` works
/// # #[cfg(feature = "invocation")]
/// # fn main() -> errors::StartJvmResult<()> {
/// # use jni::{AttachGuard, objects::JValue, InitArgsBuilder, JNIEnv, JNIVersion, JavaVM, sys::jint};
/// # //
/// // Build the VM properties
/// let jvm_args = InitArgsBuilder::new()
///           // Pass the JNI API version (default is 8)
///           .version(JNIVersion::V1_8)
///           // You can additionally pass any JVM options (standard, like a system property,
///           // or VM-specific).
///           // Here we enable some extra JNI checks useful during development
///           .option("-Xcheck:jni")
///           .build()
///           .unwrap();
///
/// // Create a new VM
/// let jvm = JavaVM::new(jvm_args)?;
///
/// // Attach the current thread to call into Java — see extra options in
/// // "Attaching Native Threads" section.
/// //
/// // This method returns the guard that will detach the current thread when dropped,
/// // also freeing any local references created in it
/// let mut env = jvm.attach_current_thread()?;
///
/// // Call Java Math#abs(-10)
/// let x = JValue::from(-10);
/// let val: jint = env.call_static_method("java/lang/Math", "abs", "(I)I", &[x])?
///   .i()?;
///
/// assert_eq!(val, 10);
///
/// # Ok(()) }
/// #
/// # // This is a stub that gets run instead if the invocation feature is not built
/// # #[cfg(not(feature = "invocation"))]
/// # fn main() {}
/// ```
///
/// At runtime, the JVM installation path is determined via the [java-locator] crate:
/// 1. By the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, if it is set.
/// 2. Otherwise — from `java` output.
///
/// It is recommended to set `JAVA_HOME`
///
/// For the operating system to correctly load the `jvm` library it may also be
/// necessary to update the path that the OS uses to find dependencies of the
/// `jvm` library.
/// * On **Windows**, append the path to `$JAVA_HOME/bin` to the `PATH` environment variable.
/// * On **MacOS**, append the path to `libjvm.dylib` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.
/// * On **Linux**, append the path to `libjvm.so` to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.
///
/// The exact relative path to `jvm` library is version-specific.
