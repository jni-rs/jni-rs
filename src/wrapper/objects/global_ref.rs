/// guaranteed to not get collected until released. Thus, this is allowed to
/// outlive the `JNIEnv` that it came from and can be used in other threads.
///
/// `GlobalRef` can be cloned to use _the same_ global reference in different
/// contexts. If you want to create yet another global ref to the same java object
/// you may call `JNIEnv#new_global_ref` just like you do when create `GlobalRef`
/// from a local reference.
///
/// Underlying global reference will be dropped, when the last instance
/// of `GlobalRef` leaves its scope.
///
/// It is _recommended_ that a native thread that drops the global reference is attached
/// to the Java thread (i.e., has an instance of `JNIEnv`). If the native thread is *not* attached,
/// the `GlobalRef#drop` will print a warning and implicitly `attach` and `detach` it, which
/// significantly affects performance.
