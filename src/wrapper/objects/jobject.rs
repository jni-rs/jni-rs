/// Wrapper around [`sys::jobject`] that adds a lifetime to ensure that
/// the underlying JNI pointer won't be accessible to safe Rust code if the
/// object reference is released.
///
/// It matches C's representation of the raw pointer, so it can be used in any
/// of the extern function argument positions that would take a `jobject`.
///
/// Most other types in the `objects` module deref to this, as they do in the C
/// representation.
///
/// The lifetime `'local` represents the local reference frame that this
/// reference belongs to. See the [`JNIEnv`] documentation for more information
/// about local reference frames. If `'local` is `'static`, then this reference
/// does not belong to a local reference frame, that is, it is either null or a
/// [global reference][GlobalRef].
///
/// Note that an *owned* `JObject` is always a local reference and will never
/// have the `'static` lifetime. [`GlobalRef`] does implement
/// <code>[AsRef]&lt;JObject&lt;'static>></code>, but this only yields a
/// *borrowed* `&JObject<'static>`, never an owned `JObject<'static>`.
///
/// Local references belong to a single thread and are not safe to share across
/// threads. This type implements [`Send`] and [`Sync`] if and only if the
/// lifetime `'local` is `'static`.
