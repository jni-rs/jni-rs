/// A wrapper to `Auto` delete local references early (before the JNI stack
/// frame unwinds).
///
/// ---
///
/// _**Note** that it's often not necessary, or even recommended, to create an
/// `Auto` wrapper for local JNI references if you can instead rely on the
/// references being deleted when the current JNI stack frame unwinds._
///
/// ---
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// Anything passed to a foreign method or returned from JNI methods that refers
/// to a `JObject` is considered a local reference.
///
/// JNI local references belong to a JNI stack frame (the top frame at the time
/// they are created).
///
/// These JNI references are normally automatically deleted once the their JNI
/// stack frame unwinds, such as when a foreign method implementation returns
/// back to the JavaVM.
///
/// In some situations you don't want to wait until the current JNI stack frame
/// unwinds before you delete a local reference and you can wrap then with
/// `Auto` so they are deleted earlier, when they are dropped.
///
/// For example, you might be creating a very large number of temporary
/// references in a loop that can lead to running out of memory if they aren't
/// explicitly deleted before the JNI stack frame unwinds.
///
/// This wrapper type provides automatic local reference deletion when it goes
/// out of scope and gets dropped.
///
/// See also the [JNI specification][spec-references] for details on referencing
/// Java objects and some [extra information][android-jni-references].
///
/// ## `IntoAuto` trait (`.auto()`)
///
/// As a convenience, the `IntoAuto` trait is implemented for all reference
/// types (like `JObject`, `JClass`, `JString` etc). This allows you to easily
/// create an `Auto` wrapper by calling the `.auto()` method on any local
/// reference.
///
/// For example:
///
/// ```rust,no_run
/// # use jni::{objects::Auto, Env};
/// # fn example(env: &mut Env) -> std::result::Result<(), jni::errors::Error> {
/// use jni::objects::IntoAuto as _;
/// for i in 0..1000 {
///     // Ensure we aren't left with a new local for each iteration by
///     // wrapping the reference in an `Auto` wrapper.
///     let auto_delete_string = env.new_string(c"Hello, world!")?.auto();
/// }
/// # Ok(())
/// # }
/// ```
///
/// ## Alternatives
///
/// It is usually more efficient to rely on stack frame unwinding to release
/// local references in bulk instead of creating [`Auto`] wrappers that are then
/// deleted one-by-one.
///
/// If you aren't sure whether it's OK to create new local references in the
/// current JNI frame (perhaps because you don't know when it will unwind) you
/// can also consider using APIs like [`crate::Env::with_local_frame()`] which
/// can run your code in a temporary stack frame that will release all local
/// references in bulk, without needing to use [`Auto`].
///
/// You can also explicitly delete a local reference with
/// [crate::Env::delete_local_ref].
