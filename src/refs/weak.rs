// Note: `Weak` must not implement `Into<JObject>`! If it did, then it would be possible to

// the wrong JNI function to delete the reference.

/// A global reference to a Java object that does *not* prevent it from being
/// garbage collected.
///
/// <dfn>Weak global references</dfn> have the same properties as [ordinary
/// “strong” global references][Global], with one exception: a weak global
/// reference does not prevent the referenced Java object from being garbage
/// collected. In other words, the Java object can be garbage collected even if
/// there is a weak global reference to it.
///
///
/// # Upgrading
///
/// Because the Java object referred to by a weak global reference may be
/// garbage collected at any moment, it cannot be directly used (such as
/// calling methods on the referenced Java object). Instead, it must first be
/// <dfn>upgraded</dfn> to a local or strong global reference, using the
/// [`Weak::upgrade_local`] or [`Weak::upgrade_global`] method,
/// respectively.
///
/// Both upgrade methods return an [`Option`]. If, when the upgrade method is
/// called, the Java object has not yet been garbage collected, then the
/// `Option` will be [`Some`] containing a newly created strong reference that
/// can be used as normal. If not, the `Option` will be [`None`].
///
/// Upgrading a weak global reference does not delete it. It is only deleted
/// when the `Weak` is dropped, and it can be upgraded more than once.
///
///
/// # Creating and Deleting
///
/// To create a weak global reference, use the [`Env::new_weak_ref`] method.
/// To delete it, simply drop the `Weak` (but be sure to do so on an attached
/// thread if possible; see the warning below).
///
/// It is also possible to create a new JNI weak global reference from an
/// existing one. To do that, use the [`Weak::clone_in_jvm`] method.
///
///
/// # Warning: Drop On an Attached Thread If Possible
///
/// When a `Weak` is dropped, a JNI call is made to delete the global
/// reference. If this frequently happens on a thread that is not already
/// attached to the JVM, the thread will be temporarily attached using
/// [`JavaVM::attach_current_thread_for_scope`], causing a severe performance
/// penalty.
///
/// To avoid this performance penalty, ensure that `Weak`s are only dropped
/// on a thread that is already attached (or never dropped at all).
///
/// In the event that a global reference is dropped on an unattached thread, a
/// message is [logged][log] at [`log::Level::Warn`].
