## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `push_local_frame`, `delete_global_ref` and `release_string_utf_chars`
no longer check for exceptions as they are 
[safe](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/specs/jni/design.html#exception-handling)
to call if there is a pending exception (#124):
  - `push_local_frame` will now work in case of pending exceptions â€” as
  the spec requires; and fail in case of allocation errors
  - `delete_global_ref` and `release_string_utf_chars` won't print incorrect
  log messages

- Rename some macros to better express their intent (see #123):
  - Rename `jni_call` to `jni_non_null_call` as it checks the return value
  to be non-null.
  - Rename `jni_non_null_call` (which may return nulls) to `jni_non_void_call`.

- `from_str` method of the `JavaType` has been replaced by the `FromStr`
  implementation

- Improvements in macro usage for JNI methods calls. (#136):
  - `call_static_method_unsafe` and `get_static_field_unsafe` methods are allowed to return NULL object.
  - Added checking for pending exception to the `call_static_method_unsafe` method (eliminated WARNING messages in log).
